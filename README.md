# Like-Button-in-React
A Like button using React and managed the count using React state. a heart icon for the like button. 
a counter that updates when the button is clicked. The text displays the number of likes and an additional count value.

 The count is showing a decimal value instead of an integer. If this is unintentional, check how you are updating the state. You might be setting the count incorrectly, possibly adding a fraction instead of a whole number.

 This is a great beginner-friendly React project to understand state management and event handling.
